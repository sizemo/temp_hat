1. I'm going to need an external sensor. I have a number of them on the way, including one like the 680. If I use that, I'll have to change it to the 0x76 address.
2. Hat clip mechanism idea right now includes some kind of belt clip with the sensor on the top and a a small container on the bottom for the battery and the Feather.
3. Heat index calculation is easy (https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/html/heatindex_equation.shtml), but probably doesn't need to happen until I get the datalogger connected. I don't know if that's asking too much of the processor or not.
4. GPX file overlay will be easier when we get the RTC connected with the datalogger module. If I can get logic in there that matches the earliest clock time possible with the first gpx timestamp. I have no idea how to do this.
5. Mode switch button can just be a slider that connects to GND and one of the A pins that works with the boot.py logic. Start/Stop is the same. SD card is on the datalogger. Don't have a plan for the GPS chip and I don't think I have anything coming in with one. I was able to get the 400mAh feather-shaped battery in this shipment too, which means that this can be more compact and hopefully lighter. If all of the components and everything fit together perfectly, I would like to be able to slide the battery in between the datalogger and the main board. If that's not possible, I got a dev board that I can tape it to or something, but it'll be a little thicker.
