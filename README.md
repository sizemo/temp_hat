Temp Hat: A portable temperature measurement device using the Adafruit ESP32-S2 Feather with BME280

## Why tho?

Official weather measurements are supposed to be taken in the shade. When your weather person on the news tells you the temperature, it's not the temperature that you're going to feel in direct sun on a concrete sidewalk. You're going to be in higher temperatures than that. I wanted to know what kind of temperatures I'm actually running in by measuring with a portable temperature sensor that I can clip on to my hat while I'm out there.
